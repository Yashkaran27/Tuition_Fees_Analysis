# In this project I have analyzed the tuition fees dataset which is posted on the Government of Canada's Open Portal website. As an international student myself, I knew that the tuition fees I am paying is way more than what domestic students are paying. Hence, I decided to analyze and dig deep into the topic to find my answers. After analyzing the data when I turn them into visualization, I was surprised with the results.
